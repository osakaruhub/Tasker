# Tasker
Tasker is a small application for managing events.
The task (no pun intended), is to have a no dependancy, no bullshit task manager, whether you're using a GUI or creep behind a terminal.
This application come with the Server itself, and a graphical interface (and tui), and therefore need a local server Already
Roadmap:
- [] add events
- [] tag support
- [] create a timetable

# who we are
We are a small voluntary group of students that try to make software more free. Our projects are all FOSS-compliant, and never are locked behind a paywall.
-- Oskar St√ºwe, Felix Walter, Lukas Walter

For the group:
Our Build software is Gradle, and our project lies in 'app'. Therein lies a build file and the source code for our project. Please also put diagrams (doesnt just have to be PlantUML, pictures are also ok) for our project to visualise the implementation.
